    	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>My name is Kelly Eijdenberg and I've worked full-time in the creative industries in Tasmania for over a decade.</p>
        <p>I am a graphic designer with a passion for the arts, and community. I cut my teeth at studios See-Saw Illustration and Design, e.g. design and In Graphic Detail. I've also worked in communication and promotions at Volunteering Tasmania, the University of Tasmania and Fullers Bookshop. In 2010 I helped create the young reading group XYZ, which was shortlisted for Australian Book Industry Marketing Campaign of the Year Award.</p>
        <p>I also spent six years at the helm of Australia’s first young museum friends group, during which I organised over 60 arts events and produced 16 editions of our own cultural magazine. More recently I have spent my volunteer time with organisations such as the Moonah Arts Centre, TEDxHobart and Interpretation Australia.</p>
        <p>I specialise in graphic design for print, and have won several Print Industry Craftsmanship awards. I typically produce brochures, books, posters, postcards, business cards, press ads, reports, signage and newsletters for Tasmanian businesses – mainly not-for-profits. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss a project.</p>
